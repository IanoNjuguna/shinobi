# Yozaka Ninja

Yozaka Ninja is a 2D platformer game built using Python's pygame-ce library

## PLOT IDEA

Yozaka Ninja is the CEO of Unnamed East African Country Incorporated (UEAC Inc), and the company is at the risk of being declared insolvent.

To prevent this, help Yozaka collect as many coins as he can while evading his enemies (the shylocks).

## COLLABORATION

The vision is for this game to become a huge FOSS project with as many forks, portable enough to be preloaded on any computing device, and with a status similar to Tetris or Snake Xenzia. At the moment though, collaboration is closed because the focus is to create the Genesis version.

I will update this policy when the project is mature enough for collaboration along with the guidelines to follow.

However, since the game is at its conception stage - any suggestions you make will be considered.

## HOW TO RUN THE GAME SCRIPT

While in the repository's root directory, run the following OS-specific commands in your terminal:

* Linux (Tested on Debian):

``` bash
        python3 yozaka.py
```

* Windows:

``` bash
        python -u yozaka.py
```
